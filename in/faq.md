What the game wants to be:
- Kaizo (Very hard difficulty, no new maps/assets/enemies/etc., only available content rearanged to provide a new experience)
- Novel (To my knowledge this is the first or one of the first non-randomizer/non-improvement SNES ARPG ROM hack)
- Speedrunnable (There is an in-game timer in the credits, that only tracks time outside dialogues and ring menus)
- Open source (The tools which were used to create this hack are available on github)

What the game does NOT want to be:
- "Secret of Evermore 2" (More like a spin-off)
- Too easy to understand what the game wants from you (From testing sessions I know that it can be very hard to understand what I want from the player, it might take a few attempts to understand a needlessly obscure mechanic)
- Well written (Neither do I like to write a story, nor do I have the required skill set)
- Typo free (English isn't my first language and the tools do not feature spell checking)
- Lag free (Sadly it is impossible to write good content without producing lag, and in some cases I removed the dog to reduce lag)
- Visual glitch free (Some sprites will have the wrong palette, because the map uses too many palletes at once)

How it is supposed to be played:
- Without save states (you don't lose progress when dying, I only added a save feature to avoid data loss)
- Without spoilers (duh')
- Without glitches (I tried to keep most glitches in the game, notably the wings glitch wasn't fixed!)

Known bugs/problems:
- There are soft locks that require a soft reset (But I tried to point them out in the text boxes that lead to the ones I know)
- Changing the palette of a sprite looks fancy, but can corrupt and crash the game (I try to change them only in controlled scenarios)
- The "hotkeys run scripts" patch seems to corrupt the dialog boxes, alchemy animations and map data sometimes (A missingno like effect on the right side, or a incorrect tile in the background)

Reasons to message me:
- You stream the game on Twitch (I would love to watch every second)
- You found a crash/bug (And preferrably some additional information)
- You found a typo/wrong phrasing (And preferrably provide a better one)
- A boss impossibly hard (Or no challenge at all)
- You are not sure if you are soft locked (Or just missing something)
