# Alchemists

General:
- [SoE] Alchemists are like hermits, living in a cave or on top of a cliff
- [SoE] They usually reward you for interacting with them with a formula, without questioning who you are and what you want from them
- [kaizo] No OP alchemy: Heal, Act3-4 damage spells
- [SoE] No overused alchemy: Hard Ball, Crush, Sting
- [SoE] Preferably gimicky and underused alchemy, which supports the player without breaking the game
- [!SoE] Unlike vanilla they don't sell the ingredients they require, to avoid alchemy spam
- [speedrun] They have quite some textboxes to mash through

Speed Alchemist:
- Location: East of the Act1 village, on top of the cliff
- Sprite: Act2 alchemist (to avoid having too many palettes in one map)
- [DS] Gate: Petrified NPC
- Gimmick: Currently the NPC tells you that he can't hear on that (west and north) ear, so you can't cheese the gate
- [speedrun] Speed is highly underused in speedruns, because increasing hit% (and dodge%) is not particularly popular
- You can interact with the alchemist from ground level due to a programming problem (the cliff is only a fake cliff on the same level)

Defend Alchemist:
- Location: Stairs beneath the chess board, close to the Energy Core cutscene (the long one)
- Sprite: Act2 alchemist
- [SoE] Gate: Chess board boss has to be defeated
- Gimmick: -
- [speedrun] Defend is highly underused, since armor is effective HP (consumable spam)
- Is supposed to just make the game easier

Escape Alchemist:
- Location: Inside the volcano, where the viper commander sits
- Sprite: Act2 alchemist
- [DS] Gate: Petrified NPC + Levitate stone
- [kaizo] Gimmick: The gate closes behind you and you have to use Escape (or die, or waste a Mud Pepper)
- [speedrun] Escape is highly underused, but extremely strong with a limited supply of Wings
- Wings glitch is fixed and they instead teleport you to the last bonfire

Drain Alchemist:
- Location: Top of Gomis tower
- Sprite: Monk (friendly)
- [Z] Gate: Shovel + wind
- Gimmick: -
- Drain is underused, but valuable without consumable spam
